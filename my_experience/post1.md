> INDUCTION PROGRAM DAY

***DAY 1***

AS *GNE* was my dream college,my day started with a very exciting morning. I woke up at 5:00am with the excitement to start my new journey of college at guru nanak dev engennering college. I was little nervous as I started my day in hostel .  Our journey began with blessing of waheguru ji. After, we got a file outside auditorium.

After entering auditorium we waited for half an hour. Then our first speaker *MRS. HARPREEET KAUR* arrived on the stage. I
felt like home in the college. She made our day.Then our respected principal *DR.SEHIJPAL SINGH* motivated us.
Our first day was made so memorable.
